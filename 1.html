<h2>HTML</h2>
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is <strong>the basic <u>scripting language</u></strong> used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.

<br><br>A line break is the point at which two lines of text are divided. In HTML, the <br> element creates a line break. You can add it wherever you want text to end on the current line and resume on the next.
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"><p>The HTML line break element can be used to display poems, song lyrics, or other forms of content in which the division of lines is significant.</p><p style="margin-top:50px;">
For example, say you’re writing a blog post about how to address an envelope or package. You want to include an example of how to format the sender’s and recipient’s addresses. In that case, you could use the line break element to place the sender’s and recipient’s names, street addresses, and cities, states, and ZIP codes all on separate lines.</p>
